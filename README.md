## Game Rule

Try using numbers on those 4 cards to come up with a math expression that would equal 24, or decide there's no possible solution to this combination. 

Number for special cards: Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13, Ace = 1

The pattern of cards doesn't matter and the math expression must follow rules below: 

1. The math expression can only include basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), also parentheses are allowed.

2. Each card must be and can only be used once.

**Example:**

**Cards: 5 1 1 8**   

**Solution: (5 - 1 - 1) * 8 = 24**

## A Probably Useless Instruction Guide
Click "Start Game", a card deck will be shuffled and 4 cards will be shown.

Click "Next" to unravel the next 4 cards.

Click "Show Solution" to show the possible solution of current 4 cards. It could be the case that no solution is possible for displayed combination.

When a card deck finishes dealing, "New Game"instead of "Next" button will be shown. Click it to start a new round.
